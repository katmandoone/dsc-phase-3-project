# Predicting ESRB Ratings for Video Games

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to predict game ratings for PlayStation4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch games. The game data is gathered directly from the esrb.org website. By looking at the descriptors given to a game, I hope to be able to use a classification model to predict the given rating. I believe that this model will help to determine whether game ratings are 'fair,' or if there is some degree of ambiguity when a consumer consults the rating tag before deciding on a game purchase.
